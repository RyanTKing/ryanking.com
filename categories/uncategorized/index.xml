      <description>Now that school&amp;rsquo;s finally out, I&amp;rsquo;ve finally gotten around to putting my blog up. I will be giving a technical overview in the coming week after I get everything working the way I want. The purpose of this blog is to keep myself focused; if I don&amp;rsquo;t have anything interesting to write about then that&amp;rsquo;s a sign that I need to stop wasting time.
Most of the content will be related to Computer Science (as seen by the title of this post), but I may ramble about politics, video games, photography, or something else that crosses my mind.</description>
