      <description>An Editor Tale as Old as January 1, 1970 Like many people, my journey to Vim did not start at Vim; I spent many days and many nights downloading editors, installing plugins, and learning key bindings that have sinse been forgotten. I had been using SublimeText for a few years when I went into college, but like many poor soles, my first course was a Java course, which broke me, and, as despserate as I have ever been, I booked an appointment at the sinister medical practice of Dr.</description>

      <description>Hello, World Now that we have an ATS install up and running on our system, it&amp;rsquo;s time to put it to use. We sill start off by writing the standard &amp;ldquo;hello world&amp;rdquo; program because the Computer Science Tutorial Gods might smite me if we do not. Start by making a new file in your favorite text editor, (I use Emacs with the ats2-mode plugin), and enter the following text:</description>

      <description>Introduction Welcome to a new series of tutorials that I plan on writing over the course of the next several months called &amp;ldquo;The Joy of ATS.&amp;rdquo; For starters, you may not be familiar with ATS, as I wasn&amp;rsquo;t until a few months ago. From the ATS website, ats-lang.org:
 ATS is a statically typed programming language that unifies implementation with formal specification. It is equipped with a highly expressive type system rooted in the framework Applied Type System, which gives the language its name.</description>

      <title>On Campers and Counselors</title>

      <description>When someone scans your items at the supermarket or brings your food at a restaurant, it is an easy assumption that those people are simply doing their jobs; it&amp;rsquo;s rare to find someone who is passionate about scanning groceries or low-level work in the food service industry. When it comes to the job of camp counseling, most would probably assume the same thing: it&amp;rsquo;s just the means to a paycheck. For some that may be true, but for many, myself included, the paycheck is not the ends, rather, it is merely a way to justify spending two months at camp to those who &amp;ldquo;don&amp;rsquo;t get camp.</description>

      <title>Why I Work as a Camp Counselor</title>

      <description>As the counting of weeks before camp turns into the counting of days before camp, I&amp;rsquo;ve spent a lot of time reflecting on my choice to spend a second summer as a counselor at a sleep away camp. I believe it comes down to the fact that camp is, to explain mathematically, the &amp;ldquo;absolute value&amp;rdquo; of college; the majority of the positives of college are present at camp, and a majority of the inverses of the negatives of college are also present at camp.</description>

      <description>Now that school&amp;rsquo;s finally out, I&amp;rsquo;ve finally gotten around to putting my blog up. I will be giving a technical overview in the coming week after I get everything working the way I want. The purpose of this blog is to keep myself focused; if I don&amp;rsquo;t have anything interesting to write about then that&amp;rsquo;s a sign that I need to stop wasting time.
Most of the content will be related to Computer Science (as seen by the title of this post), but I may ramble about politics, video games, photography, or something else that crosses my mind.</description>
