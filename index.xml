      <description>An Editor Tale as Old as January 1, 1970 Like many people, my journey to Vim did not start at Vim; I spent many days and many nights downloading editors, installing plugins, and learning key bindings that have sinse been forgotten. I had been using SublimeText for a few years when I went into college, but like many poor soles, my first course was a Java course, which broke me, and, as despserate as I have ever been, I booked an appointment at the sinister medical practice of Dr.</description>

      <description>Oh how the family affections combat
Within this heart, and each hour flings a bomb at
My burning soul! Neither from owl nor from bat
Can peace be gained until I clasp my wombat.
&amp;ndash; Dante Gabriel Rosetti
 Wombats is a package manager inspired by Leiningen and Cargo to automate the ATS workflow.
Installation Currently the only way to install wombats is manually downloading and install.</description>

      <title> The Joy of ATS 2: A Simple Game</title>

      <description>Hello, World Now that we have an ATS install up and running on our system, it&amp;rsquo;s time to put it to use. We sill start off by writing the standard &amp;ldquo;hello world&amp;rdquo; program because the Computer Science Tutorial Gods might smite me if we do not. Start by making a new file in your favorite text editor, (I use Emacs with the ats2-mode plugin), and enter the following text:</description>

      <title>Highlight.js</title>

      <description>Highlight.js is a syntax highlighter written in JavaScript. It works in the browser as well as on the server. It works with pretty much any markup, doesnâ€™t depend on any framework and has automatic language detection.
Getting Started The bare minimum for using highlight.js on a web page is linking to the library along with one of the styles and calling initHighlightingOnLoad:
&amp;lt;link rel=&amp;quot;stylesheet&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;/path/to/styles/default.css&amp;quot;&amp;gt; &amp;lt;script src=&amp;quot;/path/to/highlight.pack.js&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt; &amp;lt;script&amp;gt;hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad();&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;  This will find and highlight code inside of &amp;lt;pre&amp;gt;&amp;lt;code&amp;gt; tags; it tries to detect the language automatically.</description>

      <description>Introduction Welcome to a new series of tutorials that I plan on writing over the course of the next several months called &amp;ldquo;The Joy of ATS.&amp;rdquo; For starters, you may not be familiar with ATS, as I wasn&amp;rsquo;t until a few months ago. From the ATS website, ats-lang.org:
 ATS is a statically typed programming language that unifies implementation with formal specification. It is equipped with a highly expressive type system rooted in the framework Applied Type System, which gives the language its name.</description>

      <title>On Campers and Counselors</title>
      <link>http://ryanking.com/blog/on-campers-and-counselors/</link>

      <description>When someone scans your items at the supermarket or brings your food at a restaurant, it is an easy assumption that those people are simply doing their jobs; it&amp;rsquo;s rare to find someone who is passionate about scanning groceries or low-level work in the food service industry. When it comes to the job of camp counseling, most would probably assume the same thing: it&amp;rsquo;s just the means to a paycheck. For some that may be true, but for many, myself included, the paycheck is not the ends, rather, it is merely a way to justify spending two months at camp to those who &amp;ldquo;don&amp;rsquo;t get camp.</description>

      <title>Why I Work as a Camp Counselor</title>

      <guid>http://ryanking.com/blog/why-i-work-as-a-camp-counselor/</guid>
      <description>As the counting of weeks before camp turns into the counting of days before camp, I&amp;rsquo;ve spent a lot of time reflecting on my choice to spend a second summer as a counselor at a sleep away camp. I believe it comes down to the fact that camp is, to explain mathematically, the &amp;ldquo;absolute value&amp;rdquo; of college; the majority of the positives of college are present at camp, and a majority of the inverses of the negatives of college are also present at camp.</description>

      <description>Now that school&amp;rsquo;s finally out, I&amp;rsquo;ve finally gotten around to putting my blog up. I will be giving a technical overview in the coming week after I get everything working the way I want. The purpose of this blog is to keep myself focused; if I don&amp;rsquo;t have anything interesting to write about then that&amp;rsquo;s a sign that I need to stop wasting time.
Most of the content will be related to Computer Science (as seen by the title of this post), but I may ramble about politics, video games, photography, or something else that crosses my mind.</description>

      <description>A service for ordering basic convenience items from cars that will be stocked with items and driving around.
This project was designed for Boston University CS411: Software Engineering.
The production version of the project can be scene live here:

Architecture The core of the project is the Ruby on Rails web application framework on top of the PostgreSQL database. The front end programming was done with HTML (in embedded Ruby files), CSS (using the SASS pre-compiler), and Javascript (using the CoffeeScript precompiler).</description>
