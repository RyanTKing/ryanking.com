# Hello

My name is Ryan King (naturally), and I am an incoming Junior at Boston University studying Computer Science. Currently, I am finishing the last of my undergraduate requirements and starting my graduate requirements since I'm doing a pursuing a combined BA/MS degree. During my senior year, I hope to have the opportunity to participate research that involves either programming language theory or parallel computing. Outside of classwork, I am very involved in my fraternity, I regularly tutor other Computer Science students who have personally requested my services, I ride my bike both to class and for exercise whenever I have free time, and I love snapping photos while exploring great city of Boston.
