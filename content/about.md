# Hello

My name is Ryan King (naturally), and I am a senior at Boston University studying Computer Science.

Outside of classwork, I am very involved in my fraternity, I regularly tutor other Computer Science students who have personally requested my services, I ride my bike both to class and for exercise whenever I have free time, and I love spending a Saturday afternoon outside by the grill.
