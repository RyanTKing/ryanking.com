# Hello

My name is Ryan King (naturally). I am a rising junior at Boston University studying Computer Science. I'm currently finishing the last of my undergraduate requirements and starting my graduate requirements since I'm doing a combined BA/MS program. I hope to do research in either programming language theory or parallel computing my senior year. Outside of classwork, I am very involved in my fraternity, tutor other Computer Science students, ride my bike, take photos, and exploring the great city of Boston. The name of my blog, _Programming with a LISP_ comes from passion for functional programming, name LISP dialects, as seen in my growing collection of obscure LISP books from the 1980s.
