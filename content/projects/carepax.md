## Architecture
The core of the project is the Ruby on Rails web application framework on top of the PostgreSQL database. The front end programming was done with HTML (in embedded Ruby files), CSS (using the SASS pre-compiler), and Javascript (using the CoffeeScript precompiler).

The map-sections of the site are made using the Google Maps Javascript API.
