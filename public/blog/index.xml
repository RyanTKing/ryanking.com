      <description>&lt;p&gt;Now that school&amp;rsquo;s finally out, I&amp;rsquo;ve finally gotten around to putting my blog up. I will be giving a technical overview in the coming week after I get everything working the way I want. The purpose of this blog is to keep myself focused; if I don&amp;rsquo;t have anything interesting to write about then that&amp;rsquo;s a sign that I need to stop wasting time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the content will be related to Computer Science (as seen by the title of this post), but I may ramble about politics, video games, photography, or something else that crosses my mind. Once classes start up again, I&amp;rsquo;ll probably be doing more detailed posts on classes as well as any research I get to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope that someday I&amp;rsquo;ll post something useful or interesting, but I&amp;rsquo;m rarely useful or interesting so I&amp;rsquo;m not optimistic&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
